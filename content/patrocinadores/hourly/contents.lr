## Sobre Hourly
¡Bienvenido a Hourly! Somos una fast-paced insurtech startup con oficinas en Palo Alto, California; además de Medellín y Bogotá, Colombia. We’re laser-focused on taking something that’s complicated and scary—paying your team, payroll taxes and workers’ comp insurance—and making it super-duper simple.

## What’s working at Hourly like?
We’re a special bunch. We’re all fully remote, which makes us highly collaborative, understanding and resourceful. We share a mission to make the world a better place with a service that makes it easier for business owners to pay, insure and manage their Hourly workers. And while we’re invested in our service, we’re equally invested in each other's personal development. We’re tight-knit, we’re genuine and we’re eager to do a better job than we did the day before.
