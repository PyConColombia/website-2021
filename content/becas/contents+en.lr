We are pleased to announce the scholarships for PyCon Colombia 2021!
We believe that the key to building a thriving community is to have a diverse set, with multiple points of view and opinions, that is why the effort focused at generating this opportunity. In an ideal world, the technology community would be composed of people from all fields, places and backgrounds. However, the reality is that we must be proactive and make an effort to ensure that everyone has a voice and can be present. We know that PyCon Colombia can be expensive, that is why this scholarship wants to support people who currently do not have the resources to attend the conference.

We believe that this scholarship can be of great benefit to:

* Members of under-represented and vulnerable communities in the field of technology.
* Those who study or work in computer science or a related field with no resources to attend the conference.

To apply for the scholarship, read the following instructions and complete the form provided at the bottom.

Keep in mind that each application will be reviewed individually by the _[PyCon Colombia Organizing Team](http://pycon.co/es/scholarship)_ and classified according to the answers provided in the application form and in the letter of intent.

_Submitting your application does not guarantee that you are immediately eligible. See terms and conditions._
