information: I'm a high school teacher, and a masters student in the Innovation with Educational Technologies at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte Master's program. I'm also a PyLadies Brazil co-founder, chair in the first edition of PyLadies Brazil Conference. I've been working in the Python women's community at a national level for the past couple of years. I believe that it's through education that we will be able to make a change in ourselves, in the community we are a part of, and in the country that we live in.
